    "My name is Roman Ghimire Khatri. I come from the eastern part of Nepal, Birtamode-4, Jhapa. I am a student, currently doing my bachelors in Computer Science and Information Tech.",
  earlier: {
    first:
      " I went to Newton's Education Academy for Middle school and Kanchanjunga Namuna College was my High school.",
    second:
      "I consider myself as a well-disciplined and a bright student since my childhood. Even though my life turned dramatically into Techs, however I was once a student of Biological Science and wanted to persue more knowledge on Medical Science. Thus I did my pre-medics from Vibrant Institue in Kathmandu and started the preparation.",
    third:
      " Along with uncertain exam dates and covid pendamics, my preparation was getting disturbed at the last hours, which probably led me to not get a scholarship in Dental Surgery, neither MBBS.",

  present: {
    first:
      "I then had to grab an academic seat on Mechi Multiple Campus for BSC. CSIT as a tech student. I am now dedicated to being a professional in Software Engineering, and my prime interests are web development and AI. I have worked many hours on projects that I believe will support me in this journey. In college, we have been taught about many high-level and low-level languages. Besides academic studies, I am a passionate musician and have been doing professional music for 4 years now. I have a good number of followers on social media, especially on TikTok. I am trying to balance both music and tech in my life and am currently focused on doing what makes human life easier.",
